# PCB and Schematic
## NOTE: This is a rev1 board, use caution when basing designs off this*

These are EasyEDA source files for rev1 of UR Mom, a 36 key split bluetooth keyboard influenced by the [Ferris](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris) and [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) boards. UR Mom is a shield for the [nice!nano v2](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/), with the intention of being able to use the nice!nano's bonus pins to drive an i2c OLED display (among other things).


### Some things that I will be adding in rev2:
* Smaller through holes for better switch alignment
* Choc switches for lower profile
* Actual mounting holes for the screen breakout
* Better spacing to accommodate all three bonus pins from the nice!nano
* Improve the thermal relief on the ground side to make soldering easier
* Other things that I'm probably forgetting
